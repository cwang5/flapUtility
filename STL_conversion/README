NOTE: Please make sure the coordinates are sorted, 
since parts of the algorithm depends on the data being
pre-sorted. Most data points from UIUC database and 
Javafoil are sorted.

Oct. 08, 2009
Please input the airfoil data in the following format:

upper
0.0 0.0(x-coordinate y-coordinate)
.
.
.
1.0 0.0
lower
0.0 0.0
.
.
.
1.0 0.0

the airfoil coordinates does not have to be sorted.

If the leading edge of the airfoil is not at 0.0 0.0
(and the point with the smallest x value from upper
and lower surface does not match) the first point of
the upper surface will be used as the leading edge.

Please edit the trailing edge so that it ends with 
a point. The square trailing edge is currently not
supported but might be added later.

For the flap.dat file, please input the data as 
follows:

0.6 0.2 (x-position flap)

both values are ratio to chord length of the
airfoil, so the x-position should not exceed 1.0
while the flap should remain small enough so that 
the weightless assumption could be applied.
